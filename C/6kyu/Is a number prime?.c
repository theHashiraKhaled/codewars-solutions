/*
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}

The idea to solve this problem is to iterate through all the numbers starting from 2 to sqrt(N) using a for loop and for every number check if it divides N. If we find any number that divides, we return false. If we did not find any number between 2 and sqrt(N) which divides N then it means that N is prime and we will return True. 
Why did we choose sqrt(N)? 
The reason is that the smallest and greater than one factor of a number cannot be more than the sqrt of N. And we stop as soon as we find a factor. For example, if N is 49, the smallest factor is 7. For 15, smallest factor is 3.
